# To Do Application

This is an application I built using Angular as an assessment for a company but also as a learning tool for a framework I'm unfamiliar with. It currently runs on a local server that the user needs to start by running `npm run server`.  To run the app, the user must use the command `npm start`.  Please makse sure to run `npm install` to install any dependencies my app may have.

This is v1.0.0 where you can add tasks, descriptions, tags and due dates.  You can organize them alphabetically or by date.  The next update will run on a realtime server using TypeScript, Express and PostgreSQL.  The repo for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/CollinClifford/todolist-be).  In the version after that I will implement password encryption so that the user can safely access their list of tasks.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
